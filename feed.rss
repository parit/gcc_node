				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Full Member</h4>
<p>In the process of its reintegration into the realm of Swiss cricket, the Geneva Cricket Club became an Affiliate Member to Cricket Switzerland (CS) last year. The objective for our Club was obviously to take it to the final stage by becoming a fully fledged member of the Swiss cricket federation.</p>
<p>Now the objective is accomplished! At the last Annual General Meeting of Cricket Switzerland on 18 February in Bern, Associate Members voted unanimously for elevating the status of our Club.</p>
<p>This means that Geneva CC has now voting rights and that it is automatically eligible to play any national competition under the auspices of Cricket Switzerland (we previously required an exceptional authorisation from the Members to do so). The Associate membership gives other rights to our Club, such as the power to propose amendments to the constitution or joining other Associates to call for an extraordinary General Meeting, etc.</p>
<p>The Geneva Cricket Club would like to thank everyone within and outside of Cricket Switzerland for making it possible. We are proud to be part of the great Swiss cricket family!</p>
<h4>Indoor friendlies against GICC</h4>
<p>The day that followed the Annual General Meeting, Geneva CC played two T20s against GICC at the indoor sports centre of the Bout-du-Monde in Champel. Not surprisingly, Geneva CC continued their long unbeaten run against GICC and were victorious in the two games:</p>
<p>First match: <b>Geneva Cricket Club</b>, 132 for 6 in 20 overs (Saqib 39*, Khurram 30 [retired], Leo 2-23), <strong>beat Geneva International Cricket Club</strong>, 106 all out in 20 overs (Leo 35, Khurram 2-5, Ali, 2-7), <strong>by 26 runs</strong></p>
<p>Second match: <b>Geneva Cricket Club</b>, 125 for 7 in 18.2 overs (Anser 40, Ali 27*, Girish 3-31), <strong>beat Geneva International Cricket Club</strong>, 123 for 7 in 20 overs (Wicky 33, Massoud 1-13), <strong>by 3 wickets</strong></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/genevacricketclub.wordpress.com/2150/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/genevacricketclub.wordpress.com/2150/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=genevacricketclub.wordpress.com&#038;blog=108392122&#038;post=2150&#038;subd=genevacricketclub&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of our Annual General Meeting of 26 February 2017, our Fixture Secretary and Manager Anser Mehmood publishes his report on our website:</p>
<p><em>I am very thankful to the Committee and Full Members for giving me the chance to manage the club for a third year in row. The Club Committee and players contributed to make my responsibilities much easier.</em></p>
<p><em>2016 was the year of the real revival of the Geneva Cricket Club. The Club strengthened all units and witnessed various improvements. As a first step, the Club became an affiliate member of Cricket Switzerland. It played in both national competitions: the 40â€“over Cricket Switzerland Premier League and the Mr Pickwick T20 Cup. Second, the Club improved its presence in the media: it has now a fully functional website and is pretty active on social media (Facebook and Instagram). The match reports, photos and CricHQ are used very efficiently to improve data and info on our matches and players. The Club has also provided opportunities  for some players to attend umpiring courses to become official umpires.</em></p>
<p><em>The Club has played a record number of matches with 5 more matches than in 2015. The team played a total of 25 matches across all formats, i.e. 40-over league, Pickwick T20 and friendlies throughout Switzerland and also France. The Club also organised a number of practice sessions.</em></p>
<p><em>The team traveled to Lyon for the second consecutive year. For the first time after 15 years, the Club organised a weekend trip to the South of France at Entrecasteaux, where it played a 35-over game against Entrecasteaux CC. It was a mind-blowing experience on an exceptional cricket ground with unique hospitality and sunshine.</em></p>
<p><em>The Club managed to provide kits, some equipment, delicious food, refreshments and transportation throughout the cricket season. The Club as well organised for the players a barbecue and some team meetings. After every league game, a man of the match trophy was awarded to motivate the best player.</em></p>
<p><em>At the end of the year, Geneva CC visited the AncrAges association in Annemasse, France, where some players had a good time playing cricket with young refugees from Pakistan and Afghanistan. As they were so passionate about the game of cricket,the Club thereafter responded positively to play an official indoor cricket match in January 2017. The event was very well organised, packed with a good crowd and well publicised in social media and on the Cricket Switzerland website.</em></p>
<p><em>The Club finally organised in February 2017 an Annual Family Dinner after a long hiatus. The participation of more than 40 people, including members, players and volunteers from AncrAges was very much appreciated. Trophies were awarded to the best batsman, bowler and fielder of the year. A new trophy, the David Barmes Player of the Year, was awarded too.</em></p>
<p><em>All in all, the year was very successful and the Club bounced back very strongly. We are looking forward to a new vision, to success and to playing more competitive and friendly cricket within the spirit of cricket.</em></p>
<p><em>Distinguished regards,</em></p>
<p><em>Anser Mehmood</em></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/genevacricketclub.wordpress.com/2128/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/genevacricketclub.wordpress.com/2128/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=genevacricketclub.wordpress.com&#038;blog=108392122&#038;post=2128&#038;subd=genevacricketclub&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>On 11 February, Geneva CC held up in Grand-Saconnex its annual family dinner. The annual family dinner of the club is actually an old tradition at the Geneva Cricket Club. After a few years of absence, Club Members thought that it was a good occasion to revive the custom, especially in light of a reinvigorated team!</p>
<p>Club Members and relatives were treated with delicious curry and awesome speeches by members of the Committee. Everyone was delighted to witness the come back of the oldest cricket club in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Le Geneva Cricket Club a rÃ©cemment Ã©tÃ© sollicitÃ© par l&#8217;association AncrAges d&#8217;Annemasse (France) pour organiser un match de cricket solidaire avec des rÃ©fugiÃ©s afghans et pakistanais issus de Calais.</p>
<p>En effet, cela fait environ deux mois que ces rÃ©fugiÃ©s sont arrivÃ©s Ã  Annemasse, oÃ¹ ils sont pris en charge par le Centre d&#8217;accueil et d&#8217;orientation pour mineurs. En constatant rapidement que ces jeunes Ã©taient passionnÃ©s par le cricket, Tamimount Sammar (bÃ©nÃ©vole engagÃ©e d&#8217;AncrAges) a eu l&#8217;idÃ©e ingÃ©nieuse de contacter notre club pour organiser une <a href="https://www.cricketswitzerland.ch/news/2016/cricket-in-annemasse/" target="_blank">petite rencontre qui s&#8217;est soldÃ© par un succÃ¨s</a>.</p>
<p>La rencontret a recueilli tant d&#8217;enthousiasme qu&#8217;il a Ã©tÃ© dÃ©cidÃ© d&#8217;organiser un plus grand Ã©vÃ¨nement, cette fois-ci ouvert au public. GrÃ¢ce au soutien d&#8217;<a title="https://www.facebook.com/AssociationAncrAges/" href="https://www.facebook.com/AssociationAncrAges/" target="_blank">AncrAGes</a>, <a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annemasse" href="http://www.annemasse.fr/" target="_blank">la ville d&#8217;Annemasse</a> et l&#8217;association ARIES, un match complet s&#8217;est dÃ©roulÃ© le dimanche 22 janvier 2017 au gymnase Robert Sallaz, Ã  Annemasse. Pour l&#8217;occasion, les jeunes rÃ©fugiÃ©s ont formÃ© une Ã©quipe exclusive: le Annemasse Cricket Club! Et quelle Ã©quipe!</p>
<p>Devant plus d&#8217;une cinquantaine de spectateurs, l&#8217;Ã©vÃ¨nement a dÃ©butÃ© par une explication sur les rÃ¨gles de base du cricket. Le tirage Ã  pile ou face a ensuite Ã©tÃ© gagnÃ© par Geneva CC et les joueurs d&#8217;Annemasse ont dÃ» commencer par lancer la balle. Le match Ã©tait arbitrÃ© par notre cher PrÃ©sident Hascal Gollop. Le capitaine d&#8217;Annemasse et certains autres joueurs ont dÃ©montrÃ© un talent indÃ©niable et ont rapidement fait tombÃ© le guichet! Avec plusieurs joueurs Ã©liminÃ©s, le Geneva Cricket Club se trouvait dans une situation dÃ©licate. GrÃ¢ce au sang-froid du capitaine Anser et au soutien de Khurram (vice-capitaine) et Ahmad, le Geneva CC a tout de mÃªme rÃ©ussi Ã  marquer 121 points en 16 sÃ©ries (16 overs) pour 8 batteurs Ã©liminÃ©s.</p>

<p>Durant la seconde manche, les joueurs d&#8217;Annemasse ont immÃ©diatement voulu prendre les choses en main et ont tapÃ© le plus fort qu&#8217;ils le pouvaient. MÃªme si cela n&#8217;a pas Ã©tÃ© suffisant pour eux de gagner (85 points pour 9 en 16 sÃ©ries), cela n&#8217;avait point d&#8217;importance. En effet, l&#8217;esprit et l&#8217;ambiance extraordinaire du match ont Ã©tÃ© les vrais gagnants! Le public au rendez-vous Ã©tait Ã©galement fantastique et l&#8217;organisation de l&#8217;Ã©vÃ¨nement tout simplement parfaite. La nourriture apportÃ©e par les bÃ©nÃ©voles Ã©tait Ã©galement dÃ©licieuse.</p>
<p>Le match s&#8217;est conclu par une remise de mÃ©dailles et de trophÃ©e, puis par de chaleureux remerciements, tout cela accompagnÃ©s par une joueuse de cor des Alpes. En bref, du jamais vu Ã  un match de cricket!</p>
<p>Le Geneva Cricket Club souhaiterait remercier du fond du coeur l&#8217;association AncrAges qui a permis de concrÃ©tiser une bien belle initiative. Pour notre part, nous avons fortement apprÃ©ciÃ© y participer et nous espÃ©rons que la chose se rÃ©pÃ©tera dans le futur. Le sport peut jouer un rÃ´le d&#8217;intÃ©gration significatif pour les communautÃ©s migrantes et nous sommes fiers de pouvoir y avoir contribuÃ© un peu. Peut-Ãªtre le dÃ©but d&#8217;une belle histoire?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Bout-du-Monde, 24 and 25 September 2016, GICC Cricket Festival â€“ T20 tournament</h4>
<p>For the last tournament of the season, Geneva CC waved goodbye with a smile and finally lifted a well-deserved trophy after a hard-fought season. The Geneva International Cricket Club gracefully organised an action-packed cricket festival lasting two days over a very beautiful and sunny weekend. A great initiative, well appreciated by all cricket lovers in the region. Aside from a few injured ones, nearly all players of Geneva CC contributed to the victory. Moreover, the Genevans displayed a wonderful team spirit, definitely something that must be perpetuated till the next season and beyond! Check below the brief summary of the matches played that weekend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>First match, 24 September</b></p>
<p><b>Geneva Cricket Club</b>, 201 for 7 in 20 overs (Ahmad 57*, Ankit 45, Idrees 40, Bilal 4-22), <strong>beat CERN Cricket Club</strong>, 155 for 7 in 20 overs (Claston 39, Paul 32, Ankit 2-14), <strong>by 46 runs</strong></p>
<p>Quite to the contrary of the usual pattern in most competitions, the games went from harder to easier. Indeed, the first match against CERN CC proved to be a tough one for Geneva CC , which saw another total collapse of its middle order â€“ a trend this season â€“, save Ahmad who batted with a loud bang (57* not out with 6 fours, 5 sixes plus&#8230; one single and a double!). Geneva CC batted first and thanks to him, they reached an excellent total of 201. A difficult target for CERN to chase. Their lack of power-hitters that day did not allow them to be competitive enough to get past the average +10 run rate required to win. Special honours to Geneva CC newcomers Dalwinder and Zahid who both bowled pretty well in the first innings.</p>

<p><strong>Second match, 25 September</strong></p>
<p><b>Geneva Cricket Club</b>, 196 for 8 in 20 overs (Idrees 39, Saad 37, Girish 3-31), <strong>beat Geneva International Cricket Club</strong>, 130 all out in 17.5 overs, <strong>by 66 runs</strong></p>
<p>The second match on the following day was definitely less tense than the previous one, thanks this time to a more-than-decent batting display from the top and middle order. As GICC lost the previous day by 12 runs against CERN, the former had no choice but to win in order to qualify for the final. A fierce fight was thus expected. And the game actually started very well for them. GICC commenced with the bowling, and only 3 runs were conceded in the first 3 overs, with one wicket down too. The whole situation changed rather quickly when Idrees and Aamir were able to put their eyes on the ball. In the first innings, nobody passed the half-ton mark but scores were consistently good for a T20 format (Idrees 39, Aamir 28, Ankit 25, Saad 37, Zahid 30, Ahmad 18). Geneva CC managed again to score enough runs to feel confident for the second innings, which to some extent, reflected very much the first match against CERN CC. Unfortunately, we do not have access to the scorecard nor to the notes about the second innings, so comments here can only be a bit limited. Overall, GICC players fought well but lost early wickets, which jeopardised seriously their victory. Sharp fielding and bowling by Geneva proved to be decisive. Props to Zahid who saved a boundary six while jumping in the air, took marvelous catches and bowled swift short balls. Further miscommunication between batsmen led to three run outs and GICC were all dismissed with 13 balls remaining.</p>

<p><strong>Final, 25 September</strong></p>
<p><b>CERN Cricket Club</b>, 79 all out in 19 overs (Faysal 28*, Zahid 3-10, Massoud 3-18), <strong>lost to Geneva Cricket Club,</strong> 80 for 1 in 9.3 overs (Idrees 45, Bilal 1-17), <strong>by 9 wickets</strong></p>
<p>As the visitors did not unfortunatey have their best team that day, the final was clearly a one-sided game. CERN won the toss and elected logically to bat. The match started with a maiden from Afif, followed by Paul&#8217;s wicket in the next over, scalped by Ankit. Wickets then fell about every couple of overs and none of CERN&#8217;s batsmen could stay on their crease for long. The only noticeable performance was from Faysal who scored 28 runs not out. CERN did not have their best team on the field that day but. The Afghan bowling pair of Zahid and Massoud took 3 wickets each, followed in the figures by the well-known opening bowlers Afif (2 for 7) and Ankit (2 for 14). CERN was all out before they could face the last 6 balls and had gathered 79 runs to defend.</p>
<p>The second innings was played in a rather nonchalant way by Idrees, Dalwinder and Saad. The first stayed until the end, the second was caught behind in the fourth over, whilst the third simply accompanied Idrees until the end. The target was reached in less than 10 overs, thanks also to a large number of extras conceded. Kudos to the kid Arsalan for bowling with a very good line and giving out few runs. Geneva CC won by 9 wickets with 63 balls remaining. A great way to end the season!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Bout-du-Monde, 11 September 2016, 40-over friendly match</h4>
<p><b>Geneva Cricket Club</b>, 257 for 9 in 40 overs (Aamir 63, Khurram 61*, Richard 3-42), <strong>beat Geneva International Cricket Club</strong>, 234 all out in 37.2 overs (Vipin 62, Tariq 3-38), <strong>by 23 runs</strong></p>
<p>One of the last match of the season took place on a bright day in Bout-Du-Monde. Geneva CC faced their fellows from GICC in a tight match, which was ultimately won by tail-ender Aamir and skipper Khurram. While the latter was suffering from a constraining lower back ache, the pair still scored a +100 runs partnership which propelled Geneva CC to victory. GICC had to reach a decent target of 258 runs to win and nearly did so if Vipin at one down was not dismissed with 62 runs in his tally. Tariq finished the match with the best bowling figure of 3 for 38, while Richard from GICC started very strongly by conceding no runs and taking two wickets in his first three overs. Congrats to Geneva CC for their good victory against GICC and kudos to GICC for putting up a hard chase.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Buchholz, 4 September 2016, Pickwick T20 Cup Semi-Final</h4>
<p><b>Nomads Cricket Club</b>, 115 all out in 19.2 overs (Waqas 21, Massoud 3-13), <strong>beat Geneva Cricket Club</strong>, 83 all out in 17.3 overs (Anser 24, Faheem 3-2), <strong>by 32 runs<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.crichq.com/#matches/425425/match_info" target="_blank">Full scorecard</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>High stakes for Geneva CC as they could have gotten into their first major final since 2014! It was overall a great season for the Genevan club. Too bad that it ended with a bitter loss which could have been avoided. Again and again, Geneva&#8217;s batting lineup did not hold up and did not manage to chase successfully a rather easy total. Nonetheless, this does not take away the hosts&#8217; impeccable performance in terms of bowling. As expected, Nomads were outstanding with the ball and excellent on the field too. For spectators and players, it was a thrilling semi-final!</strong></p>
<p>A sky leaden with overcast and mild temperatures provided decent conditions for cricket. Nomads won the toss and decided to bat, confident that their renowned bowling attack would wipe out the opponent in due time. It then all started very bad for the visitors: in just 5 overs, 57 runs were conceded by the opening pair of Afif and Idrees, as well as Ronak in the fifth over. Two wickets were put down though. Ball-magnet Saad caught Faheem&#8217;s hit at long off and Ronak bowled a killing full length inswinger to dismiss Waqas.</p>
<p>The next 15 overs proved to be a totally different innings though. Indeed, the run rate for the first five overs was at 11.40, while it was at 4.05 in the last 15 spells! To put it into a different perspective, just 58 runs were scored after 5 overs&#8230; Nomads were all out at 115 with 4 balls remaining, thanks to an amazing comeback from Ronak and Afif, as well as some precise bowling by Anser and Khurram (and a pretty cool direct hit from short third man by Idrees to run out Noman for a diamond duck, the second of the season!). The bowling medal should go to Massoud who took 3 wickets in 5 consecutive balls (all nicks caught behind by keeper Ahmad). He basically destroyed Nomads&#8217; middle order and finished with a great figure of 3 for 13. What an amazing turnaround for Geneva CC!</p>
<p>Geneva&#8217;s hopes to win the match and qualify for the final were pretty high then. All were conscious that Nomads&#8217;s bowling attack is perhaps the best in Switzerland and that it could damage us pretty hardly. Nevertheless, none expected that our main run scorer this season, Idrees, would go out off the second ball for a strange duck (after hitting the pad, the ball rolled to hit the stumps). While sustaining a back injury, Khurram followed suit in in the fourth over after a tremendous one-handed catch by Sudath. Although few runs were grabbed after ten overs (42 for 3), Geneva CC &#8220;only&#8221; required to score 74 runs off 60 balls to win. Easy peasy in a T20 right? But one hast o take into account the fierce bowling quartet of Sudath, Shafqat, Faheem and Farid.</p>
<p>Anser and Ronak, at no 2 and 5 respectively, started to build up a partnership that could have been the winning one, but Ronak got run out for a non-existent run at 10.5 overs and Anser was lbw&#8217;ed by offspinner Sudath at 12.1. The five remaining wickets then fell nearly every over. Visitors clung to a glimmer of hope when Massoud started to time his hitting and scored 15 runs in the 17th over. Too litttle and too late as Faheem concluded the bowling dance with two successive wickets in the 18th over. He finished the match with figures of 3 for 2, so more wickets taken than runs conceded. Just wow! Geneva CC were thus all out in 17.3 overs with 83 runs.</p>
<p>Geneva CC would like to warmly thank Nomads CC for the fantastic hosting and delicious lunch provided after the match (that syrupy baklava was finger-licking!). It was overall a great semi-final and Geneva CC is looking forward to new challenges for the next season. Cheers!</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/genevacricketclub.wordpress.com/1609/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/genevacricketclub.wordpress.com/1609/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=genevacricketclub.wordpress.com&#038;blog=108392122&#038;post=1609&#038;subd=genevacricketclub&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Bout-du-Monde, 21 August 2016, Premier League Quarter-Final</h4>
<p><b>St Gallen Cricket Club</b>, 203 for 9 in 40 overs (Nasir 114*, Anser 3-18, Ronak 3-67), <strong>beat Geneva Cricket Club</strong>, 176 all out 36.4 overs (Idrees 49, Anser 44, Nasim 4-39), <strong>by 27 runs<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.crichq.com/#matches/421461/match_info" target="_blank">Full scorecard</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What a great feat for Geneva CC to reach the quarter-finals after being away for such a long time! Unfortunately, the oldest cricket club in Switzerland fell off the competition after another weird batting lineup collapse. The crumbling down of the middle order has become a trend this season that finally proved to be fatal. Quite amazing how this match mirrored the one Geneva played against Cossonay, with the notable difference that we were not victorious this time&#8230; Overall, it was nonetheless a great match in which St Gallen&#8217;s skipper Nasir propelled the team to a good total with his stellar score of 114 not out. The visitors&#8217; bowling attack excelled too and took wickets at very opportune times. Geneva&#8217;s opening batsmen and bowlers also displayed some nice batting and swinging skills, although they were not consistent enough to pass the mark. A pity, as the match could have been won, if it were not for the huge amount of extras conceded and the collapse of the middle order.</strong></p>
<p>A beautiful bright day in Geneva on the bouncy and pacy wicket of the Bout-de-Monde set the tone for the day. Given the short boundaries and the soon-to-be-dried wet field, St Gallen won the toss and logically elected to bat. Afif and Aamir started the bowling attack and it did not took too long before St Gallen lost a wicket. At 3.2 overs, Sweeper Saad moved quickly to long on to catch a good ball by Aamir. In the next over, Afif damaged further the visitor after Naresh mishit the ball for a bowled-and-caught.Wickets then fell regularly and brought St Gallen to the edge. At the drinks break (20 overs), the score was at 67 for 6 with nearly a third of the score conceded through wides&#8230; Noteworthy was Ronak&#8217;s sharp outswinging balls which crashed twice in the same fashion against the stumps and Khurram&#8217;s super sharp boundary catch at forward square leg off Anser&#8217;s action. Two overs later, Bajwa&#8217;s wicket at number 8 fell for a slight top edge thanks t Anser. The only man to look unshaken and imperturbable was the skipper Nasir, who kept blocking the ball, scoring singles and ticking few boundaries here and there. Excellent batting from the visitors side&#8217;s captain.</p>
<p>At this stage, SGCC looked in real trouble. The score after 22 overs was 70 for 7. Then the same scenario that the one in Cossonay happened. Nasit stayed on the crease and started building up a good 53-run partnership with Niroj off the eighth wicket. Things started to accelerate dramatically after the 100 runs mark was passed after 31 overs. Niroj was bowled out by Ronak at 33.2 and Waqar was eliminated by Idrees at 36.1 (crazy diving catch by Khurram, fielder of the day), but nothing could stop Nasir who then started to blast the ball for sixes and fours all around the place. In 9 overs, the score went from 101 to a total of 203. Tremendous that is. While SGCC could have been stopped at about 100 runs, the perseverance and patience of the captain allowed the team to reach a more than decent score.</p>
<p>The second innings started quite well for Geneva CC. At the drinks break, the score was at 117 for 2 compared to 67 for 6 for St Gallen, which seemed promising. Idrees allowed the tally to go up quickly thanks to his usual aggressive batting and Anser commenced slowly, only to shift gears after having faced enough balls. Idrees was unfortunately caught behind just before scoring another half-ton and Anser followed suit in the same fashion just before the drinks break with 44 runs in his pocket. St Gallen&#8217;s bowlers bowled with fiery pace and sometimes swing. Khurram at no 3 and Saad at no 4 were setting themselves well on the crease when they got dismissed by Nasim who just shattered the whole middle order. Indeed, Nasim dismissed number 3, 4, 5 and 6 and sealed the deal with just 28 balls bowled. In just 11 overs, Geneva lost the 6 following wickets, as if batsmen lost completely hope to win the match, despite the very comfortable score at the drinks break. Reckless batting, useless slogging and lack of concentration got the best of the rest of Geneva&#8217;s battign order. Niroj put the cherry on top when last man Tariq was bowled out at 36.4 overs. SGCC won by 27 runs with 20 balls remaining.</p>
<p>There are no doubts that such loss could have been easily avoided, but that is how cricket goes. Geneva CC is now hopeful that its players will learn from their mistakes and develop their batting techniques further. All in all, it is a great achievement for Geneva CC to reach the quarter-finals after a +6-year hiatus in Swiss cricket, but a lot work is still required to ensure that the team can lift trophies again. Geneva CC will now play the T20 Swiss semi-final on 4 September and hope to improve and adjust in the meantime.</p>
<p>Go GCC!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After conceding two successive defeats in official matches, Geneva CCâ€™s players had to step up their game in order to qualify for the T20 Cup semi-finals and secure the number one spot of the group stage in the 40-over League. The two matches to be played over the last weekend were thus more than crucial. Could Geneva CC make it and seal an amazing comeback in Swiss cricket? Little reminder: although it is the oldest cricket club in Switzerland, Geneva CC did not play in any major Swiss competition for more than six years. What a great achievement as the Genevan team is now part of the cricketing elite of the country!</p>
<p>Back on topic, Geneva CC&#8217;s played on 6 and 7 August its last group stage matches in the Pickwick T20 Cup and the Premier League. GCC played first against Colts on Saturday and then against Cossonay on Sunday. Overall, it was quite a wonderful weekend with a rather stress-free and unbalanced match against Colts, followed by an astounding and extremely tense game the next day against Cossonay. Here is what happened:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>First match at Bout-du-Monde, 6 August 2016, Pickwick T20 Cup<br />
</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Geneva Cricket Club</strong>, 59 for 5 in 8 overs (Khurram 26, Ashwin 4-10), <strong>beat Swiss Colts</strong>, 58 all out 15.2 overs (Massoud 3-8), <strong>by 5 wickets<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.crichq.com/#matches/416417/match_info" target="_blank">Full scorecard</a></strong></p>
<p>What promised to be a tough game between a young and dangerous side (Colts) versus an experienced and solid team (Geneva) turned out to be a somehow unbalanced game. Indeed, even before the match started, the situation already tipped the scale in favour of Geneva CC, as Colts came with seven players only. The rest of the team was touring in Jersey so how could one blame the blokes for enjoying cricket on a beautiful Channel island?</p>
<p>Anyway, there was no doubt that Colts came for the honour and would put up a fight. The truth is that they actually did so superbly. That&#8217;s the spirit of the game! With only seven wickets in hand off the first ball, Colts started slowly but surely, in a fashion that indubitably reflected their truncated batting line. Openers Yash and Jai defended carefully and displayed some nice shots to give their team a very decent start. It took 39 balls for Geneva&#8217;s bowlers to scalp the first wicket through Ronak, granting keeper Ahmad a classic catch behind the stumps. The second, third and fourth wicket then came rather swiftly as Colts reached 38 for 4 after 10 overs. Massoud was the marksman behind the story. It is worth noting that Yash&#8217;s dismissal at 7.4 overs was made possible by a terrific backward one-handed diving catch by Ankit at the extra cover boundary. The ball was going for 6!</p>
<p>So Massoud could maybe not concretise a hat-trick in the tenth over, but the damage was done. It was only a matter of time before the two remaining wickets would fall. The innings could have ended even earlier if fielders did not miss a few run out opportunities. In the end, Swiss Colts were all out in 15.2 overs with 58 runs in their tally. Not so bad given the circumstances.</p>
<p>Colts then showed that they did not come for nothing and bowled beautifully, scaring a bit the hosts and threatening them earnestly. The fact that Captain Cool Anser (not skipper that day but that nickname fits him so well!) waved goodbye for a duck demonstrated that very well. The man left the ball and got tricked by a slick inswinger from Ashwin, only to see it slamming the off stump. Ashwin took his captaincy role seriously and bowled like a bull. He hit bullseye four times in that innings, including thrice in a single spell at 6.1, 6.4 and 6.5 overs. More than noteworthy: out of the four wickets that Ashwin took, three of them were ducks, all bowled &#8211;&gt; Anser in silver, Saeed in bronze and then Ankit for the golden ducky.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the visitors, Ashwin&#8217;s tremendous bowling in the seventh over was too late as the previous partnership between Khurram and Saad permitted Geneva to get closer and closer to the target. Idrees and Massoud finished the job and blasted the ball over the boundary in the next over, scoring together 21 runs to close the match. Kudos to Colts for the fight and congrats to Geneva for qualifying to the semi-finals!</p>

<h4><strong>Second match at En Marche, Cossonay, 7 August 2016, Premier League<br />
</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Geneva Cricket Club</strong>, 219 for 9 in 39.4 overs (Idrees 61, Ankit 53, Vikas 2-27), <strong>beat Cossonay Cricket Club</strong>, 215 all out 39.5 overs (Zahid 58, Saurab 53, Afif 4-46), <strong>by 1 wicket</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.crichq.com/#matches/416813/match_info" target="_blank">Full scorecard</a></strong></p>
<p>Just check the scorecard and look at the over comparison. This game was purely insane. Its nail-biting finish gave stomach aches to all players and spectators! Geneva CC won by a single wicket with two balls remaining whereas the final scenario could have been clearly different. The two teams played beautifully. A ridiculous amount of wides were conceded by both sides and a few fielding mistakes here and there could have given the winning edge to any team. Cossonay scored 215 runs thanks mostly to Saurab &#8220;The Tenacious&#8221; and Zahid &#8220;The Blaster&#8221;. Geneva chased the score with ease in the beginning, only to see his batsmen suddenly losing control and leaving the tail to finish the job with immense pressure.</p>
<p>Conditions were overall perfect for a good cricket match with wind, sunshine and reasonable heat. Cossonay won the toss and decided to bat despite a vigorous bowling-friendly wind. Ankit and Afif were back as the usual opening pair of bowlers and did a very decent job although the numerous wides let Cossonay cruise with a satisfactory +3 run rate. The first wicket came at 5.5 overs as Aman hit Afif&#8217;s ball super hard towards mid-on for a low catch to Saad, who actually injured himself. He actually took it like a man and came back home with a giant swollen right hand! Thereafter in the tenth over, Idrees dismissed skipper-keeper Sathya with a fierce bouncer top edging the ball towards Ronak at third man. Score after ten overs: 44 for 2.</p>
<p>With Ronak and and Ankit involved in the bowling attack, the high pressure was maintained constantly. Opener Sunil â€“ who rotated the strike well but perhaps did not take enough responsibility â€“ was finally taken out by Ankit and the middle order crumbled down in the 17th over when Ronak lbw&#8217;ed Bernard and bowled out Thileepan. Cossonay looked like they were in a really bad situation with 61 for 5 in 17 overs, but Saurab at no 4 and Vinay at no 7 stayed on their crease and defended well. The hosts passed the 100 runs threshold when Afif wreaked havoc again by bowling out Vinay. Next thing you know, Anser&#8217;s precise spin bowling finally paid off after he gave an easy catch to Idrees at long off to dismiss Manas. Everything looked in place but The Tenacious Saurab was still on the crease while The Blaster Zahid at number 9 came on the pitch with one objective: blasting it! In a bit less than 10 overs, the pair scored 84 runs together, both reaching their half-century in two successive balls in the 38th over. Zahid reached fifty in 27 balls and Saurab in 88 balls. In between the 117 to the 201 runs scored by them, Geneva&#8217;s fielders could have stopped the partnership on at least two occasions but failed doing so (missed run out chance and another catch by Saad but with one foot on the boundary). Zahid&#8217;s knock was impressive and his reflex and timing were excellent, whilst Saurab rotated the strike magnificently.</p>
<p>In the very end, Tariq managed to halt the partnership and gave a good nick behind to keeper Ahmad at 38.3 overs. Afif subsequently took honourable wickets in the last over to allow Geneva&#8217;s bowling attack to claim all wickets. Cossonay all out in the penultimate ball with 215 runs. All in all, a satisfying score, actually unexpected in the middle of Cossonay&#8217;s innings! This boded quite well for an exciting chase.</p>
<p>And what a chase it was! Ankit &#8220;Da Test Dude&#8221; and Idrees &#8220;Boom Boom&#8221; imposed their game with a 133 runs partnership. They definitely paved the way for a fluent innings. It took 140 balls for Cossonay to break the bat affair between the two, who both scored a half-ton with ease and class. Ankit displayed jaw-dropping strokes with stylish cover drives, leg glances and cool sweeps, whilst Idrees tempered his usual agressive batting, but still slapped the ball towards both the leg and off sides with power and shrewdness.</p>
<p>At 18.2 overs, when Idress was caught at long on by Saurab after a good bowling comeback by Vikas, things looked pretty okay for Geneva thanks to a fine +7 run rate and plenty of wickets in hand. Khurram at 1 down showed immediately that no one on the visitors&#8217; bench should worry. He continued to play with a tranquil Ankit until all hell broke loose. Indeed, spinners Manas and Thileepan started to improve their length and turn. Thileepan then magically tricked Ankit for a good stumping in the 26th over. Anser, who just came to replace the former, miscommunicated with Khurram on the batting end, which lead to an avoidable run out. In the next over, Anser was caught at gully after a rash stroke. 14 balls later, Massoud was caught in the same fashion, followed straight away by Afif in the next over. Manas and Thileepan were both responsible for five crucial wickets and brought down the visitors from an appeasing 161 for 1 in 25 overs to a troubling 172 for 6 after 30 overs!</p>
<p>The spinners turned the game (pun intended) into Cossonay&#8217;s favour but Saad at number 8 kept the party alive. Saad slapped the ball for two long awaited sixes in the 32nd over, but then the tremendous pressure overwhelmed and trapped Ahmad as well as newcomer Ronak. The two were eliminated by pacer Rohit in the next over with Ahmad caught behind after a slog, and Ronak caught at point by Zahid. Scoreboard was showing 190 for 8 after 33 overs, so 26 runs to win in 42 balls. Plenty of balls one could say, but the tail is known for not being able to keep its wicket&#8230; What a game we were witnessing!</p>
<p>Slowly and not so surely, Saad &#8220;Gigantik Hand&#8221; and Tariq &#8220;The Finisher&#8221;at 8 down got closer and closer to the target. Every single delivery was looked at with fear and anxiety by Geneva&#8217;s players on the bench. None could stay still, and all continued to cheer the stressed batsmen. The turning point then came when Tariq hit a four with a straight bat at 37.5 overs. The ball was rolling rather slowly on the field but could not be stopped by Aman who unsuccessfully used his feet to cut the trajectory. Tariq then hit the ball for a double. Over up and Vikas replaced Saurab. Score at the beginning of the penultimate over: 212 for 8. 4 runs to win. Vikas conceded a wide off the first delivery but managed to trick Saad after four dots. Caught easily at mid on by Rohit.</p>
<p>Manas, who participated in the pure discomfiture of Geneva&#8217;s batting lineup, came to bowl the last over. 3 runs were required to win. Parit at number 11 left the first ball for a wide and the second one too, not wide this time. He hit the third one for a single and the score was leveled. Pressure was not relieved at all as Geneva still needed to win to secure its first spot in the group&#8217;s ranking. And the last wicket could fall anytime. Two balls later, Tariq finally hit a short-pitched ball for four towards the third man boundary and Geneva CC invaded the pitch to celebrate. 219 for 9 in 39.4 overs. Geneva CC won by one lonely wicket.</p>
<p>That was the end of an extraordinary match. A great battle between two teams which showed resilience, patience and composure. Everything we love about the sport was contained in that match. The next rendez-vous for Geneva CC is the League quarter-finals against St Gallen CC on 21 August, followed by the semi-finals of the Pickwick T20 Cup against Nomads on 4 September. Cossonay might still qualify for the quarter-finals if Colts lose their match against GESLCC on 14 August. So stay tuned for the next episode!</p>
